# minicompiler
This is a small Rust project that follows [Christine Dodrill](https://christine.website)'s re-implementation of Terry Davis's TempleOS's minicompiler for performing basic arithmetic.

This was started after reading [Christine's Post](https://christine.website/blog/minicompiler-lexing-2020-10-29).
